Key Concepts

    Intent-Driven Cognitive Architecture (IDCA):
        Intents: High-level goals or objectives that drive the AI's behavior. Examples include "conquer territory," "protect ally," or "acquire resources."
        Sub-Intents: Breakdown of main intents into smaller, manageable tasks.
        Context Awareness: AI continuously assesses the environment to determine the best actions to fulfill its intents.

    Personality-Driven AI:
        Influence of Traits on Intents: Personality traits influence the prioritization and selection of intents. For example, an aggressive AI prioritizes offensive intents, while a cautious AI prioritizes defensive intents.
        Dynamic Adjustment: As traits evolve, the AI adjusts its intents and strategies dynamically.
